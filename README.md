# Machine Learning Engineering for Production

Become a Machine Learning expert. Put your machine learning knowledge to work, and expand your production engineering capabilities and begin to turn your ideas into realities.

## Setup
- Prerequisites: Python 3.10, [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install)
- Create a new virtual environment and install `requirements.txt` within each week.

## TODO
- [ ] Ansible playbook for setting one common env + prereqs. 
- [ ] Optional prereq: graphviz? 
- [ ] Work with outdated apis for now. Some stuff like `layers.DenseFeatures` are deprecated. 

## Course Structure
Each course is spread out in weeks, and are made up of video slides, lab sessions, quizzes, assignments, related course materials, code and data
